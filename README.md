# Cap-Friendly-Scraper
This is my attempt at creating a scraper for the CapFriendly site before I move on to scraping NHL PxP data
This program will only scrape 2017 data although it could be easily modified to scrape other years

My name is Matthew Barlowe and I am learning Python so my code will be rough
Any suggestions and improvements will be greatly appreciated

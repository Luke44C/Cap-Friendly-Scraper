# Cap-Friendly-Scraper
This is my attempt at creating a scraper for the CapFriendly site before I move on to scraping NHL PxP data
This program will only scrape 2017 data although it could be easily modified to scrape other years

My name is Matthew Barlowe and I am learning Python so my code will be rough
Any suggestions and improvements will be greatly appreciated

Version 1
Simple Scraper to pull data from only one year

Version 2.0
Scraper code updated to include code defined by functions and clearly commented to actual code of the program is three lines long.

Program now takes input from the user and scrapes multiple years from CapFriendly at one time.  

Version 3.0
Scraper now will write data to csv file and then to a Google Sheets file.  As of right now it writes to separate Google Sheets file.  In next version hope to have only one google sheet file with separate worksheets for each year and add code to update existing spreadsheets instead of creating new ones each time

# Cap-Friendly-Scraper
This is my attempt at creating a scraper for the CapFriendly site before I move on to scraping NHL PxP data
This program will only scrape 2017 data although it could be easily modified to scrape other years

My name is Matthew Barlowe and I am learning Python so my code will be rough
Any suggestions and improvements will be greatly appreciated

Version 1
Simple Scraper to pull data from only one year

Version 2.0
Scraper code updated to include code defined by functions and clearly commented to actual code of the program is three lines long.

Program now takes input from the user and scrapes multiple years from CapFriendly at one time.  Anticipate updating next version to allow user to input directory and name of files as they save it so it can be used on Windows and Unix OSes
